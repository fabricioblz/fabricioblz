## Bio üó∫Ô∏è

Embarking on globe-trotting adventures has given me a taste of the world, and I'm insatiable for more. The roadmap of destinations I wish to explore only keeps expanding.

Whether it's discussing the future through the lens of futurism, exchanging thoughts on cultural paradigms, dissecting the latest movies, strategizing in Dungeons & Dragons, debating philosophical tenets, or simply losing ourselves in the joy of Forr√≥, I'm all ears‚Äîand mouth!
